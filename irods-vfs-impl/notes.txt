Kerberos
--------
1. All principals must be in the same keytab.

2. Only one keytab is valid at all times (e.g. creating new keytabs invalidates old ones).

3. To create a normal principal, run:
    addprinc <principal>

4. To create a service principal, run:
    addprinc -randkey <service>/<hostname>

   The "-randkey" flag instructs Kerberos to randomize the key information.
   This bypasses the need for passwords altogether for service principals.

5. To add a principal to the default keytab, run:
    ktadd -norandkey <principal_0> ... <principal_N>

   The "-norandkey" is needed to maintain any passwords set on the principals.
   Failing to include this option will cause the passwords to be invalidated
   blocking users from accessing services.
